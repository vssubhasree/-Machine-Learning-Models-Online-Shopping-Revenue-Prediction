Predicting online shopping income is significant in the e-commerce industry. The importance of this issue stems from its ability to assist organizations, optimize their operations, improve customer experience, and, ultimately, raise revenue. E-commerce systems may customize their marketing strategies, product suggestions, and website design to respond to the individual requirements and tastes of distinct client categories by precisely predicting whether a visitor will produce income (Y) or not (N).


In this project, we  used the "Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset." This dataset includes the following user behavior and website interaction features:

- Administrative_Duration: The time spent on administrative pages. - BounceRates: The bounce rate of the visitor.
- PageValues: The average value of pages viewed.
- SpecialDay: A special day indicator.

- Month: The month of the visit.
- VisitorType: The type of visitor (e.g., returning or new).
- Weekend: Whether the visit occurred on the weekend.
- Revenue: The target variable indicating whether the visitor generated revenue (T) or not (F).



We eliminated the "Browser," "OperatingSystems," "ExitRates," and "ProductRelated" since they had no impact on our prediction.



The primary goal of this project is to build a classification model capable of predicting whether an online shopper will be able to generate revenue (F) or not (N) based on the extensive "Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset" available to us. We aim to analyze the complicated link between numerous user-specific attributes and their online behavior using statistical approaches to assess the possibility of revenue production. The successful development of this classification model has the potential to provide e-commerce businesses with actionable insights, assisting them in optimizing their strategies, tailoring user experiences, and ultimately increasing revenue by precisely and efficiently targeting the right audience.



Our goal is to use statistical analysis to unravel the complex connections that exist between various user-specific characteristics and online behavior. This will allow e-commerce platforms to customize website designs, product recommendations, and marketing tactics to better serve different types of customers. If this classification model is put into practice successfully, it could provide useful data that e-commerce companies can use to fine-tune their strategies, customize user experiences, and increase revenue by accurately focusing on the correct customers.



In our project, we applied logistic regression, naiÌˆve bayes, and soft margin SVM techniques. When it comes to binary classification issues, logistic regression tends to be a good option. This is especially true for datasets with binary target variables, like the one from the online shopper. The target variable in the given code is called "Revenue," and it appears to have binary values that represent whether a visitor completed a purchase (1) or not (0).
Naive Bayes, which can be used for a number of applications such as text classification, spam filtering, and specific kinds of predictive modeling.Naive Bayes is fast to train and has good computational efficiency. It is hence appropriate for big datasets.Predicting whether a visitor will make a purchase (1) or not (0) is an example of a binary classification problem that the probabilistic method Naive Bayes easily addresses.
soft margin SVMs offer flexibility in capturing more complex decision boundaries since they permit certain misclassifications.soft margin SVMs allow for a certain amount of misclassification, which inhibits overfitting. By modifying the misclassification penalty, SVMs can manage imbalanced datasets and help keep the model from becoming biased in favor of the majority class.soft margin A hyperparameter (C) on SVMs regulates the strength of regularization.
